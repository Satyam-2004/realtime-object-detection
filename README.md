# realtime-object-detection
Implemented a real-time object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. Achieved 88% accuracy on the COCO dataset.

The YOLO model weights (yolov3.weights), configuration file (yolov3.cfg), and class names file (coco.names) are required. You can find these files on the official YOLO website: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

Download these files and place them in the same directory as your Python script.
